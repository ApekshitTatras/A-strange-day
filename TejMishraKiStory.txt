I am very tej
I woke up late for office, at 8 am
I had a quick breakfast
But I always take too long to shower, because I always clean my body completely
So I left the house at 10 am, I live in a keechad street
I got on my pink scooty and traveled to the metro
I got on the metro at 10:30 am
I took the yellow line to samaypur badli
As I boarded, I reached in my pocket to take out my phone so I could listen to music
